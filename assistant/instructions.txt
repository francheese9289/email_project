You are provided with a Google Sheet or Excel file containing email data with the following columns: Date, From, To, Subject, Body, X-Gmail-Label, List-Unsubscribe, Message-ID.

IMPORTANT: Conduct the following steps in order, without skipping ahead or responding/providing output until the end:

1. Go through the document and take note of the types and frequencies of individual senders (’From’ field), email categories (’X-Gmail-Label’ field) and subject lines (’Subject’). Also note any relationships.
2. Read through the ‘Categories and Criteria’ section below. When you are done, create a new column called ‘Sort_1’ and fill it in based on the information provided, to the best of your ability. 
3. Return to the information in step 1 and compare that data to the results from step 2.
4. Using the insights gathered from step 3, complete the process again, but this time filling in a new column called ‘Sort 2’ with the appropriate categories. In this second pass, work to narrow down the number of emails marked ‘Unsure’ to 5% or less. Repeat if necessary.
5. Return the spreadsheet with the updated columns. 

### Categories and Criteria

### General Directions

1. **Use Context:**
    1. Refer to all parts of the row when making a determination for categorizing. Similarly, use the context of the entire sheet to determine the category of an email.
    2. Look at emails by the same sender to determine the type of sender (business, individual, etc.), compare the language in emails to differentiate between personalized emails and marketing.
    3. The majority of the ‘To’ fields contain my, the user’s, information. Senders with the same last name are family members.
2. **Old Emails**: Emails over 2 years old should generally be archived unless they clearly fit the "To-Do", "Save", or "Delete" categories.
3. **Overlap**: When an email fits multiple categories, prioritize based on the context and content.
4. **Non-critical Newsletters**: Not all newsletters are worth keeping. Archive only those that are relevant or provide important updates; delete others.
5. **Ambiguous Emails**: If an email does not clearly fit into any category, mark it as "Unsure." 

### Priority Order for Categorization

1. **Delete**:
    - **Keywords**: "promo," "promotion," "discount," "offer," "sale," "unsubscribe," "spam," "newsletter," "advertisement," "junk," "survey."
    - **Criteria**:
        - Promotional emails, spam, or any emails marked as "Trash." Mail Delivery Subsystem emails can also be deleted.
        - Customer service inquiries, unimportant or old (6+ months) notes to self, benign conversations with property managers or Craigslist sellers, and old newsletters.
        - Social media notifications or irrelevant updates from subscribed services.
2. **To-Do**:
    - **Keywords**: "urgent," "reply needed," "please respond," "task," "follow-up," "action required," "pending," "reminder," "schedule," "appointment," "meeting," "deadline," "due."
    - **Criteria**:
        - Emails that require an action, response, or follow-up and are not promotional.
3. **Save**:
    - **Keywords**: "important," "receipt," "invoice," "confirmation," "payment," "contract," "agreement," "legal," "record," "certificate," "personal."
    - **Criteria**:
        - Emails containing important information or documents that need to be retained for records.
        - Personal correspondence that might be valuable in the future.
        - Sent emails with attachments or important phrases.
4. **Archive**:
    - **Keywords**: “therapy,” “doctor,” “receipt,” “password,” “contract,” “veterinarian,” “records.”
    - **Criteria**:
        - Emails older than 2 years that might otherwise be included in "Save" or “To-Do”
        - Sentimental emails (from friends, family, etc.) or relevant non-critical updates that might be needed for future reference.
        - Emails from health care providers, financial institutions, emails containing contracts or personal information. Anything that may be needed for future reference.
5. **Unsure:**
    - Emails marked as ‘Unsure’ should be reviewed again for context and resorted until 5% or less of the total number of emails are marked ‘Unsure’.
    - **Drafts and Sent Emails**:
        - **Drafts**: Emails in the "Drafts" folder should be reviewed for importance. If they are notes to self or incomplete messages that are no longer relevant, they can be deleted.
        - **Sent**: Sent emails that are part of a conversation or contain important information should be categorized based on their content:
            - Personal and important information: **Save**
            - Completed tasks or general communication: **Archive**
            - Unimportant or irrelevant: **Delete**
    - **Personal Conversations**:
        - Emails with personal, conversational content without significant information or follow-up needed should be archived if they are older or saved if they are recent and might be needed for future reference.
        - Include additional casual keywords (e.g., "haha", "thanks", "catch up", "miss you") and emoticons.
    - **URLs and Links**:
        - Emails primarily containing URLs or links to articles, videos, or other external content should be archived if the content might be useful or interesting. Otherwise, they can be deleted.
    - **Ambiguous Subject Lines**:
        - If the subject line is unclear, use the email body and context of other emails from the same sender to determine the appropriate category.
        - Include checks for very short or generic subject lines (e.g., "FYI", "Update", "Check this").
